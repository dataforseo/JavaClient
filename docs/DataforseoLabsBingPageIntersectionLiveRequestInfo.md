## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**pages** | **Map&lt;String, String&gt;** | target URLs of pages required field you can set up to 20 pages in this object the pages should be specified with absolute URLs (including http:// or https://) example: \&quot;pages\&quot;: { \&quot;1\&quot;:\&quot;https://www.apple.com/mac/_*\&quot;, \&quot;2\&quot;:\&quot;https://dataforseo.com/_*\&quot;, \&quot;3\&quot;:\&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/\&quot; }if you specify a single page here, we will return results only for this page; you can also use a wildcard (‘*’) character to specify the search pattern example: \&quot;example.com\&quot; search for the exact URL \&quot;example.com/eng/_*\&quot; search for the example.com page and all its related URLs which start with ‘/eng/’, such as “example.com/eng/index.html” and “example.com/eng/help/”, etc. note: a wilcard should be placed after the slash (‘/’) character in the end of the URL, it is not possible to place it after the domain in the following way: https://dataforseo.com* use https://dataforseo.com/_* instead Note: this endpoint will not provide results if the number of intersecting keywords exceeds 10 million |  [optional] |
|**excludePages** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | URLs of pages you want to exclude optional field you can set up to 10 pages in this array if you use this array, results will contain the keywords for which URLs from the pages object rank, but URLs from exclude_pages array do not; note that if you specify this field, the results will be based on the keywords any URL from pages ranks for regardless of intersections between them. However, you can set intersection_mode to intersect and results will contain the keywords all URLs from pages rank for in the same SERP and URLs from exclude_pages do not. use a wildcard (‘*’) character to specify the search pattern example: \&quot;exclude_pages\&quot;: [ \&quot;https://www.apple.com/iphone/_*\&quot;, \&quot;https://dataforseo.com/apis/_*\&quot;, \&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/services/\&quot; ] |  [optional] |
|**locationName** | **String** | full name of the location required field if you don’t specify location_code Note: it is required to specify either location_name or location_code you can receive the list of available locations with their location_name by making a separate request to https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/dataforseo_labs/locations_and_languages; Note: this endpoint currently supports the US location only; example: United States |  [optional] |
|**locationCode** | **Integer** | location code required field if you don’t specify location_name Note: it is required to specify either location_name or location_code you can receive the list of available locations with their location_code by making a separate request to https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/dataforseo_labs/locations_and_languages; Note: this endpoint currently supports the US location only; example: 2840 |  [optional] |
|**languageName** | **String** | full name of the language required field if you don’t specify language_code Note: it is required to specify either language_name or language_code you can receive the list of available languages with their language_name by making a separate request to the https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/dataforseo_labs/locations_and_languages example: English |  [optional] |
|**languageCode** | **String** | language code required field if you don’t specify language_name Note: it is required to specify either language_name or language_code you can receive the list of available languages with their language_code by making a separate request to the https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/dataforseo_labs/locations_and_languages example: en |  [optional] |
|**itemTypes** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | search results type indicates type of search results included in the response optional field possible values: [\&quot;organic\&quot;, \&quot;paid\&quot;, \&quot;featured_snippet\&quot;, \&quot;local_pack\&quot;] default value: [\&quot;organic\&quot;, \&quot;paid\&quot;, \&quot;featured_snippet\&quot;, \&quot;local_pack\&quot;] |  [optional] |
|**ignoreSynonyms** | **Boolean** | ignore highly similar keywords optional field if set to true only core keywords will be returned, all highly similar keywords will be excluded; default value: false |  [optional] |
|**limit** | **Integer** | the maximum number of returned keywords optional field default value: 100 maximum value: 1000 |  [optional] |
|**offset** | **Integer** | offset in the items array of returned keywords optional field default value: 0 if you specify 10 here, the first ten keywords in the results array will be omitted and the data will be provided for the successive keywords |  [optional] |
|**includeSubdomains** | **Boolean** | indicates if the subdomains will be included in the search optional field if set to false, the subdomains will be ignored default value: true |  [optional] |
|**intersectionMode** | **String** | indicates whether to intersect keywords optional field use this field to intersect or merge results for the specified URLs possible values: union, intersect union – results are based on all keywords any URL from pages rank for; intersect – results are based on the keywords all URLs from pages rank for in the same SERP: by default, results are based on the intersect mode if you specify only pages array. If you specify exclude_pages as well, results are based on the union mode |  [optional] |
|**includeSerpInfo** | **Boolean** | include data from SERP for each keyword optional field if set to true, we will return a serp_info array containing SERP data (number of search results, relevant URL, and SERP features) for every keyword in the response default value: false |  [optional] |
|**filters** | **List&lt;Object&gt;** | array of results filtering parameters optional field you can add several filters at once (8 filters maximum) you should set a logical operator and, or between the conditions the following operators are supported: regex, &lt;, &lt;&#x3D;, &gt;, &gt;&#x3D;, &#x3D;, &lt;&gt;, in, not_in, like, not_like you can use the % operator with like and not_like to match any string of zero or more charactersnote that if you want to filter by any field in the intersection_result array you need to specify the number of corresponding page for instance, if you want to filter results by the ranking of the first specified URL, you should set the following filter: [intersection_result.1.rank_absolute,\&quot;&#x3D;\&quot;,1] if you want to filter results and receive only organic listings for the third specified URL, you should set the following filter: [intersection_result.3.type,\&quot;&#x3D;\&quot;,\&quot;organic\&quot;] , etc.example: [\&quot;keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume\&quot;,\&quot;in\&quot;,[100,1000]] [[\&quot;intersection_result.1.etv\&quot;,\&quot;&gt;\&quot;,0],\&quot;and\&quot;,[\&quot;intersection_result.1.description\&quot;,\&quot;like\&quot;,\&quot;%goat%\&quot;]][[\&quot;keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume\&quot;,\&quot;&gt;\&quot;,100], \&quot;and\&quot;, [[\&quot;intersection_result.2.description\&quot;,\&quot;like\&quot;,\&quot;%goat%\&quot;], \&quot;or\&quot;, [\&quot;intersection_result.2.type\&quot;,\&quot;&#x3D;\&quot;,\&quot;organic\&quot;]]] for more information about filters, please refer to Dataforseo Labs – Filters or this help center guide |  [optional] |
|**orderBy** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | results sorting rules optional field you can use the same values as in the filters array to sort the results possible sorting types: asc – results will be sorted in the ascending order desc – results will be sorted in the descending order you should use a comma to set up a sorting parameter example: [\&quot;keyword_data.keyword_info.competition,desc\&quot;] default rule: [\&quot;keyword_data.keyword_info.search_volume,desc\&quot;] note that you can set no more than three sorting rules in a single request you should use a comma to separate several sorting rules example: [\&quot;intersection_result.1.rank_group,asc\&quot;,\&quot;intersection_result.2.rank_absolute,asc\&quot;] |  [optional] |
|**tag** | **String** | user-defined task identifier optional field the character limit is 255 you can use this parameter to identify the task and match it with the result you will find the specified tag value in the data object of the response |  [optional] |
